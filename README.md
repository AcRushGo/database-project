# GoMall v1.0
This project is developed in a six-week database course training, which aims to practice CRUD operations of relational databases and how to complete the development of projects with certain practical functions through front-end and back-end synthesis. Therefore, based on the separation of the front and back ends of the SSM framework, this group tried to build a B2C platform (GoMall) in the context of electronic product sales.



Basic functions of the project:

1. Formulate the merchant end to assist the merchants to manage the sales of commodities, including putting on and off the shelves, classifying the commodities, and setting attributes
2. Formulate a client to assist consumers to quickly inquire products through sales volume and price classification
3. Formulate the management end, realize the setting of the ordering weight of the goods through the sorting algorithm, and manage the priority of the merchant



Our team is now in the realization stage of the project.
